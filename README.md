   This project is about creating a Personality Quiz.
   It has 3 quesitons with 2 answer options for each.

   This project was created as part of a virtual, self-paced learning program with a coding club.
    
   I used HTML 5 and CSS 3 languages to create the website.
   Besides using basic HTML tag elements, uploading images, CSS styling rules using classes and IDs etc., additionally, I learnt about incorporating buttons and div tags in webpages.
  
   I used wireframes to come up with the layout of the website.
   Furthermore, the code was written using the Replit IDE.
